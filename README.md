# QuickSort
This is a basic Quick Sort program where the user is prompted for input (Sample input list is provided in comments section). The program has two functions to traverse LTR(Left to Right) and RTL(Right to Left) . The File is well commented for better understanding. There are two print statements to show the elements getting swapped(which may be commented or deleted).
